        <p>What to expect from student living?</p>
        <p style="font-weight: bold;">Drinking</p>
        <p>During your first week at university there is usually a freshers week where student will all go out and drink together to help get to know flat mates or course mates quicker. Some people naturally will not want to partake in these events or not want to drink in the first place which is fine. However, for people that like to go out and also have this condition you have to be considerate when drinking.</p>
        <p>The main thing to remember is that this condition affects everyone differently. Unfortunatly, there is no answer for what drinks will be fine to drink. There is however certain drinks that many people have identified as being worse than others.</p>
        <li>Beers</li>
        <li>Wine</li>
        <li>Cocktails (mixing alcohols)</li>
        <p>The key is to note down your own personal reactions to certain alcohols. By taking note you can decide whether it is worth taking the risk of drinking.</p>
        <p style="font-weight: bold;">Exams</p>
        <p>Exams can be a stresssful time for students. This stress can potentially lead to flare ups. The good thing is that universitys will offer help for people that require it, student can accuire special treatment that will offer them extra time during exams if they need to take trips to the toilet.</p>
        <p style="font-weight: bold;">Assessments</p>
        <p>Assessments can also build up alot of stress, and can influence a flare-up. If this happens it is important to keep in contact with your lectures and seek their advice. You can apply for a mitigated circumstances form to allow you to get an time extention for you assessment. It is important to be reasonable with the time that you are asking for.</p>
        <p style="font-weight: bold;">Get in touch with the University doctors</p>
        <p>If you are living away from home you will need to register with the University Health Service or a local GP, which would mean a change of doctor. You can search for a new GP on the NHS website. You should still be able to see your old GP during vacations if you complete a temporary registration form when you go back home. If you inform them of your condition they canadvice you on the support they offer at the university.</p>
