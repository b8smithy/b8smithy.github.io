        <p>Ulcerative colitis is a long-term condition where the colon and rectum become inflamed. Small ulcers can develop on the colon's lining, and can bleed and produce pus.</p>

        <li>Stomach pain</li>
        <li>recurring diarrhoea, which may contain blood, mucus or pus</li>
        <li>needing to empty your bowels frequently</li>
        <p>Patients may also experience tiredness and loss of appetite. People can suffer in different ways as some people may have mild symptoms and others the condition may have some serious impact on their lives.</p>
        <p style="font-weight: bold;">Treatment</p>
        <p>As there is no cure to Ulcerative colitis, treatment revolves around relieving and keeping them in remission. The most common effective medicines include:</p>
        <li>Aminosalicylates (ASAs)</li>
        <li>corticosteriods</li>
        <li>Immunosuppressants</li>
        <p>If a flare up distubes daily life too much then it is advised to contact the hospital to recieve treatment. In certain circumstances your small intestines will be diverted out of an opening in your abdomen or be used to create an internal pouch that is connected to your anus called an ileoanal pouch.</p>
        <br>
        <p style="font-weight: bold;">Crohn's disease</p>
        <p>In the same 'family' of Colitis. Crohns disease is a life long condition where parts of the digestive system become inflammed. It is one type of a condition called inflammatory bowel disease</p>
        <p style="font-weight: bold;">Symptoms of Crohns disease</p>

        <li>Stomach aches and cramps</li>
        <li>Blood in stools</li>
        <li>tiredness (fatigue)</li>
        <li>Weight loss</li>
        <p>The symptoms may be constant or may come and go every few weeks or months. When they come back, it's called a flare-up.</p>
        <p style="font-weight: bold;">Treatment</p>

        <li>medicines to stop the inflammation coming back – either tablets or injections</li>
        <li>surgery to remove a small part of the digestive system – sometimes this may be a better treatment option than medicines</li>
