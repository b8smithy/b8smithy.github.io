        <h5>Advice for parents with children with chrons or colitis</h5>
        <img src="images/parentbanner.jpg" alt="Billy" style="height:200px" style="float:right">
        <p>This section is aimed at answering questions parents would have about this condition</p>
        <p style="font-weight: bold;">Will my child get better?</p>
        <p>Crohn's and Colitis can't be cured or taken away completely, but a lot can be done to help your child live a normal life. Many of your child's symptoms should improve after they start treatment. There may be periods of relapse when your child is unwell, but there will also be periods of remission when their symptoms more or less disappear.</p>
        <p style="font-weight: bold;">How will it affect their life?</p>
        <p>Although your child's journey through life may be different to the one you anticipated, children are very resilient, and many take it in their stride. Your child may have to slow down or take a break at times, but for many children their condition won't stop them doing the things they love.</p>
        <p style="font-weight: bold;">support for parents</p>
        <p>Your child's IBD team understand that a new diagnosis of Crohn's or Colitis can be challenging and distressing for your child â€“ and for the whole family. They should be your first point of call for any medical concerns or questions you have. IBD teams often include paediatric gastroenterologists (children's doctors in gut diseases), IBD Nurse Specialists, and in some cases psychologists, who can offer emotional support to your child and your family. Ask your child's IBD team for more information about this.</p>
