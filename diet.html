        <p>Which nutrients are important in Crohn's and Colitis?</p>
        <p style="font-weight: bold;">Iron Suppliments</p>
        <p>Low levels of iron is common issue people with Crohnâ€™s or Colitis. This is possible due to the poor diet or the body not being able to absorb enough. Lack of iron can lead to anaemia, where there are fewer red blood cells to carry oxygen around the body. Symptoms of low iron include, being tired and lacking energy, shortness of breath, pale skin, and irregular heart beats</p>
        <p>If your GP has told you that you have low iron levels in your blood, they may advise you to include high iron foods. these include leafy vegtables, cereals, eggs, meats, peas and beans. They may also prescribe iron tablets.</p>
        <p style="font-weight: bold;">Vitamin B12</p>
        <p>For most people Vitamin B12 isnt an issue as it comes from a wide variety of food such as meat, fishm milk, cheese, eggs and cereals with added B12. Vitamin B12 is absorbed in the last part of the small intestine called the terminal ileum. If you have surgery to remove the ileum, or if you have inflammation in that area, you may not be able to absorb vitamin B12. For this people will get injections every three months to prevent B12 levels from getting too low.</p>
        <p style="font-weight: bold;">Vitamin D</p>
        <p>Your body makes vitamin D from the sunlight along with certain foods such as, oily fish, egg yolks and tother foods with added vitamin D. People with Crohn's and Colitis are at risk of having low levels of vitamin D. without being treated this could lead to bone pain</p>
        <p style="font-weight: bold;">Calcium</p>
        <p>Calcium is an important for stroong bones and teeth. Calcium primarily comes from dairy foods but can also come from foods with added calcuim supplies. A popular medication for Crohn's and Colitis is steriods and a possible side effect of this is brittle bones. For this doctors will prescribe calcium tablets</p>
        <p style="font-weight: bold;">Fibre</p>
        <p>Fibre is also broken down in the colon. People with crohns and colitis can be more sensitive to the effects of fibre in the gut. For some, fibre can help ease the symptoms of a flare-up. On the other hand fibre is known to make peoples symptoms worse. Advice for this would be to talk to your GP and track foods eaten in a diary to help see what is causing the flare-ups.</p>
